# aliaser-pro-database-api
Aliaser-PRO is an application created for the purpose of generating aliases for repeating text values
stored in the database. This way the database size gets smaller, while the application joins
initial text values by assigned aliases when fetched from the database.

The project has been created as part of the Databases classes at Poznań University of Technology.
